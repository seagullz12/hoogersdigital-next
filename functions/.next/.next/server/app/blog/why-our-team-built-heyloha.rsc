# Why our team built Heyloha: AI agents that handle customer conversations 24/7

## What is Heyloha?

Heyloha is an AI-powered customer service platform that uses large language models to answer customer questions through both chat and phone calls. Our team built Heyloha to solve a fundamental problem: businesses lose customers to slow response times, teams get overwhelmed by repetitive questions, and scaling customer support is expensive.

## The problem Heyloha solves

**Customer support challenges in 2025**

Businesses face several critical customer service challenges:
- Customers expect instant answers 24/7, but human teams cannot maintain round-the-clock availability
- Support teams spend hours daily answering the same questions repeatedly
- During peak hours, missed calls mean lost leads and revenue
- Hiring additional support staff for basic inquiries is not cost-effective
- Traditional chatbots provide scripted responses that frustrate customers

## How Heyloha works: AI chat and phone agents

### AI chat agent for websites

Heyloha's AI chat agent deploys directly on your website and provides instant answers to customer questions. The system automatically reads and learns from your website content, creating a knowledge base without manual programming.

**Key features:**
- 24/7 availability with no downtime
- Automatic website content ingestion
- Additional knowledge sources (FAQs, documents, product information)
- Complete conversation logging and labeling
- Visibility into customer questions and concerns

### AI phone agent

The AI phone agent answers incoming telephone calls using natural voice synthesis and real-time response generation. This feature handles common customer inquiries without hold music, transfers, or voicemail.

**Experience it yourself:** Call +31 970 102 757 79 to speak with our AI phone agent.

**Phone agent capabilities:**
- Natural, conversational voice
- Real-time question understanding and response
- Intelligent conversation flows
- Immediate answers to frequently asked questions
- No call queues or busy signals

## Measurable business results

Heyloha delivers quantifiable improvements in customer service metrics:

**Conversion rate:** 23% increase in conversions (based on Glassix research on AI chatbot implementation)

**Support efficiency:** 70% reduction in repetitive customer questions (from Heyloha client case studies)

**Time savings:** Approximately 10 hours per week saved for support teams (calculated from 30 daily questions Ã— 4 minutes saved per interaction)

## Implementation and setup

**Quick deployment**

Heyloha launches in 30 minutes, not 30 days. No technical expertise required. The AI automatically ingests website content and begins handling customer conversations immediately.

**Human handoff system**

The AI resolves 90% of customer conversations independently. For complex issues requiring human judgment, the system seamlessly transfers conversations to team members with full context, eliminating customer frustration from repeated explanations.

**Complete visibility and analytics**

Every AI conversation is recorded, searchable, and automatically categorized. This provides insights into:
- Customer pain points and common questions
- Product or service gaps
- Seasonal trends in customer inquiries
- Opportunities to improve knowledge base content

## Roadmap: future Heyloha features

### Email AI integration

Coming soon: AI-powered email management that drafts response suggestions, maintains conversation context, and routes complex inquiries to appropriate team members.

### WhatsApp business integration

Planned feature: AI responses on your WhatsApp Business number, providing 24/7 messaging support on the platform where customers prefer to communicate.

## Why businesses choose Heyloha

**Scalability without headcount**

Customer service scales automatically as business grows. Handle 100 or 10,000 monthly inquiries without proportional increases in support staff.

**Never miss a lead**

Customers who contact you outside business hours receive immediate responses instead of finding competitors who are available.

**Free up human teams**

Support staff focus on complex problem-solving, customer relationships, and high-value interactions instead of answering routine questions.

**Customer satisfaction**

Zero wait times and instant answers improve customer experience compared to traditional support queues.

## Technical details

### What makes Heyloha different from traditional chatbots

Traditional chatbots follow decision trees and scripted responses. Heyloha uses large language models (LLMs) to understand conversational context, intent, and nuance. This enables natural conversations that adapt to customer needs rather than forcing customers into predetermined conversation paths.

### Data security and privacy

Customer conversations are encrypted and stored securely. Businesses maintain full control over their data and can export conversation logs at any time.

## Team and company

Heyloha is developed by a team dedicated to making AI customer service accessible and effective for businesses of all sizes. We focus on practical implementation, measurable results, and continuous improvement based on real-world usage.

Our team combines expertise in:
- Natural language processing and large language models
- Customer service operations and best practices
- Software engineering and system architecture
- User experience design
